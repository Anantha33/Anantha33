- 👋 Hey, how's it going? My name is Anantha, but people often call me Andy;
- 👀 I’m interested in playing football, software programming and getting enough sleep whenever I can (not in any specific order hahaha);
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a Master of Cyber Security while learning a lot of programming languages including but not limited to Python, Java, SQL;
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a small project which will help me enhance my ability to solve real-world problems and improve my critical thinking abilities as well as my soft skills;
- 📫 How to reach me you ask? ananth.bharatarajan@gmail.com is my e-mail id. We can catch up over a cup of coffee, if we're in the same city;
